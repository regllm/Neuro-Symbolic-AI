# ðŸ¤– Open Source Poker AI

This repository will contain a best effort, open source implementation of the key ideas required to implement a poker AI.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/fedden/poker_ai/blob/develop/assets/poker.jpg">
</p>

_Made with love from the developers [Leon](https://www.leonfedden.co.uk) and [Colin](http://www.colinmanko.com/)._

## Pre-requisites

This repository assumes Python 3.7 or newer is used.

## Installing

There isn't much to do with this repository at the moment but one could install the Python package by cloning this repo and pip installing it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fedden/poker_ai.git # Though really we should use ssh here!
cd /path/to/poker_ai
pip install .
```

## Running tests

I'm working on improving the testing as I progress. You can run the tests by moving to this repositories root directory (i.e `poker_ai/`) and call the python test library `pytest`:
```bash
cd /path/to/poker_ai
pip install pytest
pytest
```

â”‚                  # to help formulate understanding and ideas.
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts        # Scripts to help develop the main library.
â””â”€â”€ test           # Python tests.
    â”œâ”€â”€ functional # Functional tests that test multiple components 
    â”‚              # together.
    â””â”€â”€ unit       # Individual tests for functions and objects.
```

## Code Examples

Here are some assorted examples of things that are being built in this repo.

### State based poker traversal

To perform MCCFR, the core algorithm of pluribus, we need a class that encodes all of the poker rules, that we can apply an action to which then creates a new game state.

```python
pot = Pot()
players = [
    ShortDeckPokerPlayer(player_i=player_i, initial_chips=10000, pot=pot)
    for player_i in range(n_players)
]
state = ShortDeckPokerState(players=players)
for action in state.legal_actions:
    new_state: ShortDeckPokerState = state.apply_action(action)
```

### Visualisation code

We are also working on code to visualise a given instance of the `ShortDeckPokerState`, which looks like this:
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/fedden/pluribus-poker-AI/blob/develop/assets/visualisation.png">
</p>

It is so we can visualise the AI as it plays, and also debug particular situations visually. The idea as it stands, is a live web-visualisation server like TensorBoard, so you'll just push your current poker game state, and this will be reflected in the visualisations, so you can see what the agents are doing. 

[_The frontend code is based on this codepen._](https://codepen.io/Rovak/pen/ExYeQar)

Here is an example of how you could plot the poker game state:
```python
from plot import PokerPlot
from pluribus.games.short_deck.player import ShortDeckPokerPlayer
from pluribus.games.short_deck.state import ShortDeckPokerState
from pluribus.poker.pot import Pot


def get_state() -> ShortDeckPokerState:
    """Gets a state to visualise"""
    n_players = 6
    pot = Pot()
    players = [
        ShortDeckPokerPlayer(player_i=player_i, initial_chips=10000, pot=pot)
        for player_i in range(n_players)
    ]
    return ShortDeckPokerState(
        players=players, 
        pickle_dir="../../research/blueprint_algo/"
    )


pp: PokerPlot = PokerPlot()
# If you visit http://localhost:5000/ now you will see an empty table.

# ... later on in the code, as proxy for some code that obtains a new state ...
# Obtain a new state.
state: ShortDeckPokerState = get_state()
# Update the state to be plotted, this is sent via websockets to the frontend.
pp.update_state(state)
# http://localhost:5000/ will now display a table with 6 players.
```

### Playing a game of poker

There are two parts to this repository, the code to manage a game of poker, and the code to train an AI algorithm to play the game of poker. A low level thing to first to is to implement a poker engine class that can manage a game of poker.

The reason the poker engine is implemented is because it is useful to have a well-integrated poker environment available during the development of the AI algorithm, incase there are tweaks that must be made to accomadate things like the history of state or the replay of a scenario during Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimisation. 

The following code is how one might program a round of poker that is deterministic using the engine. This engine is now the first pass that will be used support self play.

```python
from pluribus import utils
from pluribus.ai.dummy import RandomPlayer
from pluribus.poker.table import PokerTable
from pluribus.poker.engine import PokerEngine
from pluribus.poker.pot import Pot

# Seed so things are deterministic.
utils.random.seed(42)

# Some settings for the amount of chips.
initial_chips_amount = 10000
small_blind_amount = 50
big_blind_amount = 100

# Create the pot.
pot = Pot()
# Instanciate six players that will make random moves, make sure 
# they can reference the pot so they can add chips to it.
players = [
    RandomPlayer(
        name=f'player {player_i}',
        initial_chips=initial_chips_amount,
        pot=pot)
    for player_i in range(6)
]
# Create the table with the players on it.
table = PokerTable(players=players, pot=pot)
# Create the engine that will manage the poker game lifecycle.
engine = PokerEngine(
    table=table,
    small_blind=small_blind_amount,
    big_blind=big_blind_amount)
# Play a round of Texas Hold'em Poker!
engine.play_one_round()
```

## Roadmap

The following todo will change dynamically as my understanding of the algorithms and the pluribus project evolves. 

At first, the goal is to prototype in Python as iteration will be much easier and quicker. Once there is a working prototype, write in a systems level language like C++ and optimise for performance. 

### 1. Game engine iteration.
_Implement a multiplayer working heads up no limit poker game engine to support the self-play._
- [x] Lay down the foundation of game objects (player, card etc).
- [x] Add poker hand evaluation code to the engine.
- [x] Support a player going all in during betting.
- [x] Support a player going all in during payouts.
- [x] Lots of testing for various scenarios to ensure logic is working as expected.

### 2. AI iteration.
_Iterate on the AI algorithms and the integration into the poker engine._
- [ ] Integrate the AI strategy to support self-play in the multiplayer poker game engine.
- [x] In the game-engine, allow the replay of any round the current hand to support MCCFR. 
- [x] Implement the creation of the blueprint strategy using Monte Carlo CFR miminisation.
- [ ] Add the real-time search for better strategies during the game.

### 3. Game engine iteration.
_Strengthen the game engine with more tests and allow users to see live visualisation of game state._
- [x] Start work on a visualisation server to allow a game state to be displayed. 
- [ ] Triple check that the rules are implemented in the poker engine as described in the supplimentary material.
- [ ] Work through the coverage, adding more tests, can never have enough.
