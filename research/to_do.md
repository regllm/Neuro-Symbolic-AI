A Place for Next Steps in Short Deck Implementation

## Abstraction

#### Information Abstraction
- hard code opening hand clusters
- decide if we need lossless for the short deck game, maybe come back to it if not
- decide how to store these for lookup in blueprint/real time algo
- run for short deck

#### Action Abstraction
- not sure how this fits into blueprint/real time yet

## Blueprint Algo
- apply to contrived short deck game

## Real Time Search Algo
- need isomorphic/lossless handling of cards
- mock up "toy" version 
  - pre-req: stateful version of short deck

### Rules of Contrived Short Deck Game
- 3 players
- 2-9 removed
- no adjustments to hand rankings versus no-limit
- 10000 in stack, 50 small blind, 100 big blind

#### Possible Next Steps
- fix shot deck game and roll out to online hosting?
- go right on to full game?
